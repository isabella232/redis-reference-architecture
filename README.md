# Redis Reference Architecture

This repo contains reference architecture in the form of Spring apps
to fulfill frequent use cases that can be used with the [Redis for PCF](http://docs.pivotal.io/redis)
offering.

The example applications in this repo are written in Java and make use of the compatibility of
[Spring](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/buildpacks/java/getting-started-deploying-apps/gsg-spring.html)
with Cloud Foundry bound services.

See the individual READMEs in the examples for more information on how they function and are run on Pivotal Cloud Foundry.
